**Mitigation Steps:**
1)	Make regular backups of your most important files - it will be different for every organisation - check that you know how to restore files from the backup, and regularly test that it is working as expected. 
2)	Make multiple copies of files using different backup solutions and storage locations. You shouldn't rely on having two copies on a single removable drive, nor should you rely on multiple copies in a single cloud service.
3)	Ensure that backups are only connected to known clean devices before starting recovery.
4)	Scan backups for malware before you restore files. Ransomware may have infiltrated your network over a period of time, and replicated to backups before being discovered.
5)	Regularly patch products used for backup, so attackers cannot exploit any known vulnerabilities they might contain.
